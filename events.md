- HTML events are "things" that happen to HTML elements.
    - When JavaScript is used in HTML pages, JavaScript can "react" on these events.
    - Here are some examples of HTML events:
        -  An HTML web page has finished loading
        - An HTML input field was changed
        - An HTML button was clicked
- Often, when events happen, you may want to do something.
-  JavaScript lets you execute code when events are detected.

- Common HTML events:
    - onchange: An HTML element has been changed
    - onclick: The user clicks an HTML element
    - onmouseover: The user moves the mouse over an HTML element
        - `<div onmouseover="this.style.backgroundColor='red'">myDIV.</div>`
    - onmouseout: The user moves the mouse away from an HTML element
    - onkeydown: The user pushes a keyboard key
    - onload: The browser has finished loading the page
